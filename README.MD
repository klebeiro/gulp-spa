## About The Project

I've created this project when i was studying gulp.js. It consists in a SPA(Single Page Application) model with a bunch of files that i used gulp.js to automatically create a build of the application only with the necessary files. Also, the build runs on a local server that restarts if any file change, bringing the build updates in development. 

### How to use

- Install NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Download gulp by enter this command in your cmd: "npm install --global gulp-cli" 
- Install the node application modules by typing "npm i" in the root of repository.

To run and see the build result and the server running just access the root of the repository and type "gulp" in cmd.
